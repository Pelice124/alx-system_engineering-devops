What's a Server?

A server is like a helpful computer or program. It does tasks for other programs and their users, called clients. Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant.
The Client-Server Model

The client is the one asking for things. It's usually your internet-connected device, like a computer or phone, and the software you use to access the web, such as Google Chrome. In this example, the client is like you ordering food in a restaurant.
The server is the one providing what the client asked for. It stores websites and apps. In our example, it's like the kitchen in the restaurant making your food.
When your device wants to see a webpage, it asks the server for a copy of that webpage, which is then shown on your web browser, just like the waiter brings your meal to your table.
The Phonebook of the Internet

When you type a web address like "https://www.google.com" in your browser, the first thing your browser does is figure out where to find that website. It needs something like a phonebook for the internet.
What's a URL?

A URL is like an address for a website. It has parts like the protocol (https://), the hostname (www.google.com), and more. In our case, we're looking at the protocol and hostname. It's similar to knowing the street name and the building number to find a place.
DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS is like the internet's phonebook. It translates human-friendly website names into machine-friendly IP addresses. Every device on the internet has a unique IP address, and DNS helps your device find the right one.
The process of DNS involves several steps and servers, like asking for directions:
First, your request goes to a server called the DNS recursor.
If that server doesn't know the exact location, it asks a root server for clues.
The root server points to the right place, like telling you which city to go to.
The final server, called the authoritative nameserver, knows exactly where to find the website's IP address.
Internet Protocol Suite

Now that your browser knows where to find a website, it's time to connect. Browsers use protocols to make this happen.
One of the most common protocols is TCP/IP, which ensures data is sent correctly over the internet. It's like following the rules to send and receive messages or packages.
Traffic and Security Control

Once your browser connects, it's time to send and receive data. But before that, there's traffic control.
Load balancers, like traffic cops, make sure web traffic is distributed evenly among different servers to avoid overloading any single one.
Firewalls act as security guards, deciding who can enter and who can't. They have rules like checking IDs to keep things safe.
SSL (Secure Socket Layer)

Security is crucial, especially when sharing sensitive information. SSL is like a secret code between your device and a website to keep your conversation private. It's vital when sharing things like credit card details.
HTTP/HTTPS

HTTP is like the language your browser uses to talk to a web server when you ask for something.
HTTPS is just like HTTP, but with extra security. It's like making sure your message is sent in a sealed envelope, keeping it safe from prying eyes.
HTTP Requests and Response Status Codes

Whenever you ask for something on a website, it's like sending a request. The website's response tells you if it worked or not, similar to getting a message back from your request.
Web and Application Servers

Web servers are like chefs in a restaurant. They serve static content, such as web pages and images. These are things that don't change much.
However, many websites have dynamic content that changes, like interactive features. For this, we need application servers. They handle these dynamic tasks.
Database

Databases are like digital libraries that store information. The database server is the librarian who retrieves, adds, and updates data.
There are different types of databases, like relational databases (think traditional libraries) and non-relational databases (more like digital archives).
Conclusion

All of these steps happen quickly, even before you notice when you type a website address. I hope this simplified explanation helps you understand what happens when you visit a website like www.google.com. It's like a well-organized process that ensures you get the information you want from the internet.
