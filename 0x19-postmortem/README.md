Well, let me spill the tea on what went down when ALX's System Engineering & DevOps project 0x19 hit the stage in Ghana at 06:00 (GMT). Picture this: an Ubuntu 14.04 container playing host to an Apache web server decided to throw a fit. Instead of serving up a sleek HTML file for a Holberton WordPress site, all it handed out were those dreaded 500 Internal Server Errors. Not the warm welcome we were expecting.

So, our bug whisperer, Bamidele (or Lexxyla, if you're into cool made-up names like I am), caught wind of this hiccup around 19:20 PST and got right into Sherlock mode to crack the case.

First stop, checking running processes with a trusty `ps aux`. Found two Apache2 processes, one playing the role of root and the other as www-data. Seemed normal so far.

Next, a dive into the sites-available folder at /etc/apache2/. All good there; it pointed to content in /var/www/html/.

Time for the heavy artillery: strace. Fired it up on the root Apache process and sent a curl request. Expected fireworks but got nada. No useful info from strace, talk about a buzzkill.

Round two, strace on the www-data process. Set expectations low, and jackpot! Unearthed an -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) error when it tried to cozy up with /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp.

On a mission through the files in /var/www/html/ with Vim, playing detective. Found the sneaky .phpp file extension hanging out in wp-settings.php at line 137. Tossed out the trailing 'p' like yesterday's leftovers.

Curl test round two. Bam! 200 A-okay!

Feeling generous, crafted a Puppet manifest to make sure this typo never pulled this stunt again. The 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp now sweeps through /var/www/html/wp-settings.php, swapping any phpp drama for clean php goodness.

In a nutshell, it was a typo throwing a tantrum. The WordPress app choked on class-wp-locale.phpp instead of the correct class-wp-locale.php. Fixed it with a simple snip-snip.

Now, for future prevention, let's all chant together: "Test, test, test!" Try the app before letting it out in the wild. And get yourself some watchful eyes like UptimeRobot to scream at you if things go south.

Oh, and about that Puppet manifest? It's like having a superhero on standby to fix any phpp mess in wp-settings.php. But hey, we're programmers â€“ we never make mistakes, right? ðŸ˜‰
