Secured Three-Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com:

User Accesses the Website:

A user enters "www.foobar.com" in their browser.
Domain Name and DNS:

The domain "foobar.com" is registered and managed with DNS.
DNS includes an "A" record for "www.foobar.com" pointing to the IP addresses of the three servers.
Load Balancer with SSL Termination:

The load balancer handles incoming requests and terminates SSL connections.
SSL termination decrypts encrypted traffic, ensuring secure communication.
Firewalls:

Three firewalls protect each server from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
They act like digital guards, allowing only legitimate traffic.
Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx handles web requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests.
Application Server:

The application server processes dynamic requests, manages application logic, and generates responses.
Set of Application Files (Code Base):

Application files contain the code necessary for the website to function.
They include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side code.
Database (MySQL Cluster):

A MySQL cluster consists of multiple servers, enabling data replication and failover.
One server is for writes, while others serve as replicas for reads.
SSL Certificate:

An SSL certificate secures communication between users' browsers and the web servers.
It's like a digital lock that keeps data safe during transmission.
Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors):

Monitoring clients collect data about server performance, traffic, and other metrics.
This data is sent to a monitoring service like Sumo Logic for analysis.
Explanations for Additional Elements:

Firewalls: Firewalls act as security barriers, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic to prevent unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
SSL Certificate: SSL ensures encrypted communication, safeguarding data from being intercepted by malicious parties.
Monitoring Clients: Monitoring clients collect data on server health, user behavior, and performance for proactive issue detection.
Monitoring Data Collection:

Monitoring clients gather server metrics and send them to Sumo Logic, where they're analyzed to identify performance trends, anomalies, and potential issues.
Monitoring Web Server QPS:

To monitor the web server's queries per second (QPS), you'd configure the monitoring tool to track the incoming request rate to the web server.
Issues with this Infrastructure:

SSL Termination at Load Balancer Level:
Terminating SSL at the load balancer can expose decrypted traffic between the load balancer and the application servers.
Single MySQL Server Accepting Writes:
Relying on a single MySQL server for writes creates a single point of failure; if it goes down, write operations are affected.
Uniform Server Components:
Using identical server components can lead to uniform vulnerabilities; if one component is compromised, all servers are at risk.
