Imagine someone wants to visit a website called www.foobar.com. Let's break down how this works:

User Wants the Website:

So, picture a person typing "www.foobar.com" into their web browser.
Domain Name and DNS:

To make this magic happen, the name "foobar.com" is like the address of the website.
This "address" is registered with a special system called DNS, like a phonebook for websites.
We tell DNS that "www.foobar.com" should take you to a server with the number 8.8.8.8.
Server:

The server is like the big computer that holds the website stuff.
It's the place where all the website's pieces come together.
Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx, the web server, is like the friendly face at the entrance of a store.
It welcomes you and checks what you're looking for.
Application Server:

The application server is the clever part that makes the website work.
It takes the requests from the friendly face (web server), does the thinking, and prepares the right stuff to show you.
Application Files (Code Base):

Think of these files as the building blocks of the website.
They have all the instructions on how the website should look and what it should do.
Database (MySQL):

The database is like a super organized storage room for website information.
It keeps stuff like user accounts, posts, and comments neatly organized.
Talking to Users:

The server chats with your computer using a special language called HTTP or HTTPS.
When you click around the website, your browser and the server have a chat to show you the right stuff.
Challenges with this Setup:

One Weak Point:

Since everything relies on this single server, any hiccups with it could break the website.
Pause for Fixes:

When we need to fix things or put in new code, the web server has to take a quick nap.
During this nap, the website might not be available, causing a tiny break.
Can't Handle a Crowd:

If lots of people show up to the website, this single server might feel overwhelmed.
It's like a small car trying to carry too many passengers.
